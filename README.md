# SimpleAiTranslate

A Chrome extension for selecting text to translate that combines AI.
When you select a single word, it will tell the Ai about the sentence or paragraph and the word index in it. Then the Ai will give the single meaning of this word, and the IPA together.
When you select a sentence, it will tells the Ai about the paragraph.
It should support people to supply custom ai base url, api key and model, and also support common ai like openai, gemini, claude.
