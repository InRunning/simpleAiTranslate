# Phase 0: Research & Technology Decisions

## Plasmo Framework Research

### Decision: Use Plasmo LTS Version
**Rationale**: Plasmo provides a modern development experience for Chrome extensions with built-in hot-reloading, automatic manifest generation, and TypeScript support. The LTS version ensures stability while still receiving important updates.
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Manual Chrome extension development (more control, but slower development)
- Other extension frameworks (less mature, smaller community)

### Plasmo Architecture Benefits
- **Hot-reloading**: Changes reflect in browser within 2 seconds as specified
- **Automatic manifest management**: No manual JSON editing required
- **TypeScript support**: Better developer experience and type safety
- **Modular structure**: Clean separation of content scripts, background scripts, and UI components
- **Built-in development tools**: Debugging and error reporting capabilities

## Chrome Extension Manifest V3 Compliance

### Decision: Full Manifest V3 Support
**Rationale**: Chrome requires Manifest V3 for new extensions. Plasmo has full V3 support including service workers for background scripts.
**Key considerations**:
- Service workers instead of persistent background pages
- Content script isolation
- Secure storage mechanisms for API keys

## Data Storage & Privacy

### Decision: Encrypted Local Storage with User-Controlled Cloud Sync
**Rationale**: Meets constitutional privacy requirements while providing user flexibility. Chrome's storage APIs provide secure local storage, and user-controlled sync ensures privacy.
**Implementation approach**:
- Chrome.storage.local for encrypted local data
- Chrome.storage.sync for user preferences (with user consent)
- Custom encryption layer for sensitive data (API keys)

## AI Provider Integration

### Decision: Modular Provider Interface
**Rationale**: Maintains constitutional requirement for multi-AI provider support while allowing easy addition of new providers.
**Provider support strategy**:
- OpenAI, Gemini, Claude as primary providers
- Custom provider interface for user-defined AI services
- Standardized request/response format across all providers
- Independent configuration storage per provider

## Development Environment

### Decision: macOS + VS Code Focused
**Rationale**: As specified in clarifications, focusing on macOS with VS Code provides the best developer experience.
**Tooling considerations**:
- Plasmo CLI for development and building
- VS Code with TypeScript and Chrome extension debugging extensions
- Chrome Developer Tools for extension debugging

## Error Handling Strategy

### Decision: Detailed Error Logging with User-Friendly Messages
**Rationale**: Meets clarified requirement for comprehensive error handling while maintaining good user experience.
**Implementation approach**:
- Structured error logging in development
- User-friendly error messages in production
- Error boundaries in React components
- Graceful degradation for non-critical failures

## Performance Optimization

### Decision: Hot-Reload Within 2 Seconds
**Rationale**: Meets clarified performance requirement for development experience.
**Optimization strategies**:
- Plasmo's built-in hot-reloading capabilities
- Efficient build process with caching
- Lazy loading of non-critical components
- Optimized content script injection

## Testing Strategy

### Decision: Comprehensive Testing with TDD Approach
**Rationale**: Meets constitutional TDD requirement while ensuring extension reliability.
**Testing framework selection**:
- Jest for unit tests
- Chrome Extension Testing Framework for integration tests
- Playwright for end-to-end testing
- TDD workflow implementation

## Security Considerations

### Decision: Security-First Approach
**Rationale**: Meets constitutional security requirements for extension development.
**Security measures**:
- HTTPS for all external API calls
- Encrypted storage for sensitive data
- Minimal permissions requested
- Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation

## Summary of Research Decisions

All research decisions align with both the constitutional requirements and the clarified specifications. The Plasmo framework provides an excellent foundation for accelerating Chrome extension development while maintaining all existing functionality and meeting privacy, security, and performance requirements.

Key technology stack:
- **Framework**: Plasmo (LTS version)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Testing**: Jest + Chrome Extension Testing Framework
- **Storage**: Chrome Storage APIs with encryption
- **AI Integration**: Modular provider interface
- **Development**: macOS + VS Code

All NEEDS CLARIFICATION from the Technical Context have been resolved through this research phase.
