# Feature Specification: Use Plasmo for Development

**Feature Branch**: `001-use-plasmo-for-development`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to use plasmo to speed up development"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs
   - Privacy implications and data handling
   - Multi-provider support requirements
   - Custom prompt requirements and validation rules
   - Extension-specific constraints (Manifest V3, content scripts)

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: 在规格文件中，关于热重载性能期望没有明确标准。对于 Plasmo 开发环境，您期望的热重载时间是多少？ → A: 热重载应在2秒内完成，提供即时反馈
- Q: 规格文件中没有明确开发环境的特定要求。对于 Plasmo 开发环境，您希望支持哪些操作系统和开发工具？ → A: 仅支持 macOS，使用 VS Code 作为主要开发工具
- Q: 规格文件中没有明确用户数据的处理方式和隐私要求。对于 Plasmo 开发的扩展，您希望如何处理用户数据（如 API 密钥、翻译历史等）？ → A: 所有数据加密存储，支持用户控制的云同步
- Q: 规格文件中没有明确的错误处理策略。当 Plasmo 构建失败或扩展运行时出现错误时，您希望如何处理这些情况？ → A: 提供详细的错误日志和用户友好的错误消息
- Q: 规格文件中没有明确 Plasmo 版本的兼容性要求。您希望使用哪个 Plasmo 版本，以及如何处理未来的版本更新？ → A: 使用长期支持版本，确保稳定性

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to use Plasmo framework to accelerate the development of the SimpleAiTranslate Chrome extension, so that I can build features faster with better developer experience and reduced boilerplate code.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the project is set up with Plasmo, **When** I run the development command, **Then** the extension loads in Chrome with hot-reloading enabled
2. **Given** Plasmo is configured, **When** I create a new content script or background script, **Then** it automatically builds and updates without manual manifest editing
3. **Given** the existing extension requirements, **When** Plasmo is integrated, **Then** all existing functionality (text selection, AI translation, multiple AI provider support) is preserved
4. **Given** Plasmo's development environment, **When** I make code changes, **Then** I see updates reflected in the browser within 2 seconds

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Plasmo's build process conflicts with existing project structure?
- How does the system handle migration of existing Chrome extension APIs to Plasmo's abstractions?
- What happens when Plasmo's version updates break existing functionality?
- How does the system handle development environment setup across different operating systems?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST support all existing SimpleAiTranslate functionality after Plasmo integration
- **FR-002**: The development environment MUST provide hot-reloading capabilities for faster iteration
- **FR-003**: The build process MUST automate manifest generation and management
- **FR-004**: The system MUST support content scripts, background scripts, and popup components using Plasmo's structure
- **FR-005**: The development workflow MUST reduce boilerplate code compared to manual Chrome extension development
- **FR-006**: The system MUST maintain support for multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, custom APIs)
- **FR-007**: The text selection and translation functionality MUST work identically to the original specification
- **FR-008**: The system MUST support custom AI configuration (base URL, API key, model, prompts)
- **FR-009**: The development environment MUST provide debugging tools and error reporting
- **FR-010**: The build output MUST be a standard Chrome extension that can be published to the Chrome Web Store

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Development Environment**: Represents the Plasmo-based setup for building and testing the extension
- **Build Configuration**: Represents the settings and scripts that automate the extension building process
- **Extension Components**: Represents the various parts of the Chrome extension (content scripts, background scripts, popup)
- **AI Provider Integration**: Represents the connection to various AI services for translation functionality
